# Simple Tasks Blocks

Simple Tasks Blocks is a standalone, lightweight task manager for Obsidian. It allows you to manage tasks in categorized blocks within your sidebar, completely independent of your Markdown notes.

## Key Features

- **Standalone Management**: Tasks are stored internally and do not clutter your notes or vault.
- **Categorized and Movable Blocks**: Group your tasks into clean, rounded blocks that can be reordered by drag-and-drop.
- **Due Dates & Calendars**: Assign dates to tasks with a built-in date picker.
- **Smart Sorting**: Sort tasks chronologically. Tasks without dates are automatically treated as "Today".
- **Visual Alerts**: Overdue tasks turn red, and tasks due today are highlighted.
- **Fully Customizable**:
    - Change block colors via a right-click menu.
    - Toggle confirmation for task deletion (Choose option in parameters)
    - Support for international date formats (DD-MM-YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD).
- **Productivity First**: Fold/Unfold blocks and clean all completed tasks with one click.

## How to use

1. Open the **Simple Tasks Blocks** view from the ribbon icon (list-checks).
2. Click **+ Category** to create your first block.
3. Add tasks directly inside the blocks.
4. Use the **Command Palette** or **Shortcut** to quickly create a new category.
